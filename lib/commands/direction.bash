# Aijigu Direction Directory

This directory stores direction files for aijigu.

## Format

Direction files are named in the format `<id>-<title>.md` (e.g., `1-setup-database.md`).

## Completed Directions

Once a direction has been completed, it should be moved to the `completed/` subdirectory
(e.g., `completed/1-setup-database.md`).

Steps:
1. Read the task content from $file.
2. List existing .md files in $AIJIGU_DIRECTION_DIR and $AIJIGU_DIRECTION_DIR/completed to find the highest numeric ID prefix. The next ID is max + 1, starting from 1 if none exist. Do not zero-pad the ID.
3. Generate a short, lowercase, hyphen-separated title from the task content in the same language as the input (e.g. 'setup-database' for English, 'データベース構築' for Japanese).
4. Write the task content to $AIJIGU_DIRECTION_DIR/<id>-<title>.md.
5. Output only the created filename (e.g. '1-setup-database.md') to confirm." \

1. Read and understand direction #${id}.
2. Carry out the work as directed.
3. Append work notes to the direction file.
4. If the work is fully completed, move the direction file to the completed directory.
5. If the work is within a Git-managed area and fully completed, commit the changes.
